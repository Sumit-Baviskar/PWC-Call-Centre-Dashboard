# PWC-Call-Centre-Dashboard

#**Introduction :**

The Call Centre Dashboard is developed as part of a PwC job simulator project, designed to provide a detailed view of call center performance metrics. It serves as a centralized platform for visualizing key data such as total incoming calls, average speed of response, total talk duration, and customer satisfaction ratings. This dashboard allows users to delve into specific aspects of call center operations, such as the distribution of resolved vs. unresolved cases, the rate of answered versus abandoned calls, and trends in customer queries by topic. The intuitive interface and visual elements make it easy to identify patterns and trends in call center activities.

#**Purpose :**

The purpose of the Call Centre Dashboard in this PwC job simulator is to equip call center managers and analysts with the tools they need to evaluate operational efficiency and enhance customer service delivery. By integrating metrics like resolution rates, average answer speed, and satisfaction ratings, the dashboard aids in identifying bottlenecks and areas that require attention. It enables the team to analyze data at various granularities, from agent performance to monthly trends, allowing for more precise management of resources and strategies. Ultimately, this dashboard supports data-driven decision-making, enabling call center teams to improve response times, optimize issue resolution processes, and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. It also provides valuable insights for strategic planning, ensuring that the call center meets its service goals and maintains a high standard of customer support.
