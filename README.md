# PWC-Call-Centre-Dashboard

# **Introduction :**

The Call Centre Dashboard is developed as part of a PwC job simulator project, designed to provide a detailed view of call center performance metrics. It serves as a centralized platform for visualizing key data such as total incoming calls, average speed of response, total talk duration, and customer satisfaction ratings. This dashboard allows users to delve into specific aspects of call center operations, such as the distribution of resolved vs. unresolved cases, the rate of answered versus abandoned calls, and trends in customer queries by topic. The intuitive interface and visual elements make it easy to identify patterns and trends in call center activities.

# **Purpose :**

The purpose of the Call Centre Dashboard in this PwC job simulator is to equip call center managers and analysts with the tools they need to evaluate operational efficiency and enhance customer service delivery. By integrating metrics like resolution rates, average answer speed, and satisfaction ratings, the dashboard aids in identifying bottlenecks and areas that require attention. It enables the team to analyze data at various granularities, from agent performance to monthly trends, allowing for more precise management of resources and strategies. Ultimately, this dashboard supports data-driven decision-making, enabling call center teams to improve response times, optimize issue resolution processes, and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. It also provides valuable insights for strategic planning, ensuring that the call center meets its service goals and maintains a high standard of customer support.


# **Task :**
Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset :

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

**1. Overall customer satisfaction**

**2. Overall calls answered/abandoned**

**3. Calls by time**

**4. Average speed of answer**
   
**5. Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered**

# **Overview of Call Center Dashboard :** 

## **Dashboard 1 Insights :**

- **Total Incoming Calls :** Displayed as a large numeric value, the dashboard shows 5,000 total incoming calls, indicating the volume of interactions received.

- **Average Speed of Answer :** The metric is shown as 67.52 seconds, representing the average time taken to answer incoming calls.

- **Total Talk Duration :** A numeric value of 4,054 minutes, indicating the total time spent on calls.

- **Average of Satisfaction Rating :** Represented by a circular gauge, the average satisfaction rating is 3.40 out of a scale from 0.00 to 6.81, suggesting moderate customer satisfaction levels.

- **Sum of Resolved Cases :** A donut chart illustrates the proportion of resolved cases. 81.08% of cases are resolved (yellow segment), while 18.92% remain unresolved (red segment).

- **Sum of Call Answered vs. Abandoned :** Another donut chart, with similar percentages, shows that 81.08% of calls were answered (yellow) and 18.92% were abandoned (red).

- **Count of Answered vs. Topic :** A bar chart provides insights into the topics of calls answered. It categorizes the issues into Streaming, Technical Support, Payment-Related, Admin Support, and Contract-Related, with varying numbers of answered calls in each category. Streaming has the highest count, while Contract-Related has the lowest.

- **Count of Answered vs. Month :** A clustered bar chart displays the count of calls answered and not answered each month (January, February, and March). Yellow represents answered calls, and red represents those not answered, with each month showing a similar pattern of call distribution.


## **Dashboard 2 Insights:**

- **Count of Resolved Issues :** A donut chart indicates that 72.92% of issues are resolved (yellow segment), while 27.08% remain unresolved (red segment), giving a visual representation of the resolution rate.

- **Count of Call vs. Issues :** Another donut chart shows the breakdown of calls by issue type, with percentages close to 20% each for Streaming, Technical Support, Payment-Related, Admin Support, and Contract-Related issues, indicating a fairly even distribution of call topics.

- **Agent Performance Table :** A table lists individual performance metrics for agents like Becky, Dan, Diane, Greg, Jim, Joe, Martha, and Stewart. The table includes:

- **Answered Count :** The number of calls each agent answered.

- **Resolved Count :** The number of calls resolved by each agent.

- **Average Satisfaction Rating :** Each agent’s average customer satisfaction score, ranging from around 3.33 to 3.45.

- **Average Speed of Answer in Seconds :** Indicates how quickly each agent responds to calls, with values ranging from 65.33 to 70.99 seconds.

- **Count of Answered (Y/N) by Satisfaction Rating :** A horizontal bar chart breaks down the number of calls answered based on satisfaction ratings from 1 to 5. Ratings of 3, 4, and 5 have the highest number of calls answered, while ratings of 1 and 2 have lower counts.

# **Final Recommendation :**


**1. Improve Response Time :** Reducing the average speed of answer from 67.52 seconds could significantly enhance customer satisfaction. Implementing better call routing, increasing staffing during peak times, or using automation for initial interactions could help achieve this.

**2. Focus on Agent Training :** Enhancing training programs for agents, especially in the areas of Streaming and Technical Support, could improve resolution rates and overall satisfaction. This will also help agents handle complex queries more efficiently.

**3. Analyze Unresolved Cases :** The 18.92% unresolved case rate in the first dashboard and 27.08% unresolved issues in the second highlight a need to delve into the reasons behind these. Identifying common barriers to resolution could help in creating more effective troubleshooting guides or scripts for agents.

**4. Address Call Abandonment :** To reduce the abandonment rate, consider evaluating peak call times and adjusting staffing accordingly. Additionally, offering self-service options or call-back features can decrease the likelihood of customers hanging up.

**5. Leverage Monthly Insights for Strategic Planning :** The monthly breakdown of answered calls suggests potential seasonal trends. Use this data for strategic workforce management and preparing for periods of increased demand to maintain service levels.

**6. Balance Speed with Quality :** Striking the right balance between speed of response and quality of interaction can lead to better customer satisfaction ratings. Continuous monitoring of agent performance and regular feedback sessions can aid in maintaining this balance.




# **Conclusion :**

The Call Centre Dashboard, part of the PwC job simulator, provides a comprehensive view of call center performance through clear visualizations and detailed metrics. It highlights key areas such as resolution rates, response speed, and satisfaction ratings, offering valuable insights for managers to optimize operations. By focusing on improving response times, enhancing agent training, and addressing unresolved cases, the call center can achieve higher customer satisfaction and more efficient service delivery. Utilizing this data-driven approach ensures that the call center is well-equipped to meet customer needs and adapt to evolving service requirements, ultimately driving better customer retention and operational success.
